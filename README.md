# wireframing

<h2>Introduction</h2>  
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or application.  
<h2>Importance</h2>
- Clarifies structure and functionality <br>    
- Facilitates collaboration  <br>
- Saves time and money by identifying issues at an earlier stage  <br>
- Prioritizes content structure and placement <br>

<h2>Key Elements</h2>  
1. Layout Structure <br> 
It is a framework that defines the overall arrangement of the page.  <br>
Example: A blog website wireframe might have a narrow sidebar on the left for navigation and a wide main content area on the right for the article. <br>
2. Navigation <br>
It shows how users will move through the website or app. <br>
Example: A navigation bar at the top of an e-commerce site with links to "Home" and "Shop". <br>
3. Content Placement <br>
It shows where and how content, such as text and images will be arranged. <br>
Example: On a product page, the wireframe will show a placeholder for the "Add to Cart" button. <br>
4. Functionality <br>
It refers to the interactive elements of the design, such as buttons, forms, sliders, and interactive widgets and shows what these elements are and how they will behave. <br>
Example: A contact form on a website will be represented by boxes for the user's name, email, and message, along with a "Submit" button. <br>
<h2>Types of Wireframes</h2>  
1. Low-fidelity wireframe: are the simplest form of wireframes and show the general structure with less detail. Used for early-stage brainstorming. <br>
2. High-fidelity wireframe: shows more detail. Used for user-testing and feedback. <br>
- The type of wireframe in the example is high-fidelity <br>
<h2>Popular Wireframing Tools</h2>  
- <b>Figma</b>: It is a leading tool due to its versatility and collaborative features. It allows designers to move seamlessly from creating low-fidelity wireframes to producing high-fidelity prototypes and final designs within the same file. <br>

<h2>Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development</h2>  
By creating a clear blueprint early on, wireframes provide a solid foundation for developers, project managers, and quality assurance (QA) teams. It guides the development process and facilitates team communication. <br>
<h2>Wireframing in Practice</h2>
<p>During the redesign of a mobile banking app, the design team created low-fidelity wireframes to map out the user flow for transferring money. Initially, the wireframes showed a multi-step process: selecting the account to transfer from, selecting the recipient, and then entering the amount. User testing with these wireframes revealed a significant usability issue: users were confused about the order of operations and often selected the recipient before the source account, leading to frustration. The team quickly resolved this by revising the wireframe to a more linear, intuitive flow. The updated wireframe consolidated the process into a single screen where the user could select both the "from" and "to" accounts, enter the amount, and see a summary, all in one place. This change was easily and cheaply implemented at the wireframing stage. By catching this flaw early, the team prevented costly and time-consuming code changes during development. The final product was a more efficient, user-friendly, and logical banking app that received positive feedback for its streamlined transfer process. This essential step in the design process helps to clarify the user flow, facilitate communication among team members, and save time and money by identifying usability issues early on.</p> <br>
