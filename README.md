# wireframing

<h2>Introduction</h2>  
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or application.  
<h2>Importance</h2>
- Clarifies structure and functionality <br>    
- Facilitates collaboration  <br>
- Saves time and money by identifying issues at an earlier stage  <br>
- Prioritizes content structure and placement <br>

<h2>Key Elements</h2>  
1. Layout Structure <br> 
It is a framework that defines the overall arrangement of the page.  <br>
Example: A blog website wireframe might have a narrow sidebar on the left for navigation and a wide main content area on the right for the article. <br>
2. Navigation <br>
It shows how users will move through the website or app. <br>
Example: A navigation bar at the top of an e-commerce site with links to "Home" and "Shop". <br>
3. Content Placement <br>
It shows where and how content, such as text and images will be arranged. <br>
Example: On a product page, the wireframe will show a placeholder for the "Add to Cart" button. <br>
4. Functionality <br>
It refers to the interactive elements of the design, such as buttons, forms, sliders, and interactive widgets and shows what these elements are and how they will behave. <br>
Example: A contact form on a website will be represented by boxes for the user's name, email, and message, along with a "Submit" button. <br>
<h2>Types of Wireframes</h2>  
1. Low-fidelity wireframe: are the simplest form of wireframes and show the general structure with less detail. Used for early-stage brainstorming. <br>
2. High-fidelity wireframe: shows more detail. Used for user-testing and feedback. <br>
- The type of wireframe in the example is high-fidelity <br>
